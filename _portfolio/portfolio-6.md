This project consists of two main parts: Hardware and Software:

**Hardware**
The hardware part includes the design of the circuit board and the bill of materials (BOM). Essential components: LED Matrix
Micro-controller(atmega328)
Quartz crystal unit
Printed Circuit Board

**Software**
The software part is composed of code written in Arduino, which drives the operation of the hardware. And I use KiCAD for PCB design and verification.
