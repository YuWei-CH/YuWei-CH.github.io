### About Me

I am a first-year Master of Computer Science student at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign(UIUC)**. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from New York University (NYU), where I also worked part-time with the [NYU High-Performance Computing Team](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/).

I have interned at [Scientific Computing Core, Flatiron Institue](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/scientific-computing-core/) and served as a research intern at the [Scalable Architecture Lab](https://sarchlab.org/) under the guidance of [Prof. Yifan Sun](https://sarchlab.org/syifan) before. 

My research and professional interests span **high-performance computing**, **parallel computing**, **computer architecture** and **machine learning**.

### Current Focus

I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree while continuing research at the Flatiron Institute, where I focus on optimizing the GPU performance of [nifty-ls](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nifty-ls), an open-source library for high performance Lomb-Scargle periodograms.
