### About Me

I am a senior Computer Science undergraduate at New York University, working with the [NYU High-Performance Computing Team](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/). I am currently interning at the [Scalable Architecture Lab](https://sarchlab.org/) under the guidance of [Prof. Yifan Sun](https://sarchlab.org/syifan). My interests span **computer architecture**, **high-performance computing**, and **backend development**.
